<p>If you are interested in presenting or participating in SWERP, please email Brandon Ives at <a href="mailto:bives@snu.ac.kr">bives@snu.ac.kr</a>.</p>

<p>We ask presenters to provide a draft of their working project a week before the workshop date to allow sufficient time for participants to read the paper. The workshop will last 75 minutes and take place on Zoom. Presenters will have 25-30 minutes to present their research project. A designated discussant will then use approximately 10 minutes to provide constructive feedback. We will then use the remaining time for audience Q&A and an open discussion.</p>
