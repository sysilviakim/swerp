    <p>Based in Seoul, SWERP offers an online forum for research projects in political science. Our aim is to provide researchers an opportunity to present in-progress research, receive feedback, and improve their projects. Professors, researchers, and advanced graduate students are encouraged to attend and participate. We welcome all research topics related to political science, including but not limited to international relations, comparative politics, Korean politics, and American politics.</p>

    <p>If you are interested in presenting or participating in SWERP, please email Brandon Ives at <a href="mailto:bives@snu.ac.kr">bives@snu.ac.kr</a>.</p>
